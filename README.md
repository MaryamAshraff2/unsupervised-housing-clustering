# Housing Clustering Project 

This project demonstrates unsupervised clustering techniques (K-Means, K-Medoids, and DBSCAN) applied to the same housing dataset (`housing.csv`). Each notebook includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Clustering using the respective algorithm
- Visualization of clusters using PCA

## Notebooks
- `kmeans_clustering.ipynb`: K-Means clustering
- `kmedoids_clustering.ipynb`: K-Medoids clustering
- `dbscan_clustering.ipynb`: DBSCAN clustering

## Dataset
- `housing.csv` is a synthetic dataset containing features such as price, location, size, etc.

## Running the Notebooks
Open each notebook in Google Colab to view results interactively or download the file and upload the .ipynb file on colab or jupiter notebook.
